This campaign will all revolve around a central dungeon that is built on the inside of a mountain. This dungeon reaches up into the mountain and down deep under the mountain. This dungeon has more and more monsters and traps the deeper you go and the end goal of this dungeon is to stop what is at the bottom because it is releasing monsters into the world and they are slowly working their way higher up in the dungeon and will eventually spill out into the world.

Within the dungeon is a care taker who looks after the dungeon ensuring it is fit for exploring and ensures the monsters don't make it to the higher levels. He will be a key character when exploring this dungeon.

With the dungeon being the key focus of the campaign it will be vital to ensure the party are well equipped for the dungeon so will have to work in the towns surrounding the dungeon and have to take the dungeon on gradually and explore the world around the mountain to gather the equipment and knowledge needed.
