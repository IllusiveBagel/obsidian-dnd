# Overview
---
This dungeon is a large multilayered structure built in a mountain that can be accessed from the base of the mountain and contains many layers going both up into the mountain and down deep under the mountain. This is a very common spot for adventurers to explore and [[Care Taker]] has taken it upon himself to look after and maintain to ensure that it is not only fit for people to explore but also to stop the evils within from leaking out into the world.
