# Overview
---
This dungeon is a large multilayered structure built in a mountain that can be accessed from the base of the mountain and contains many layers going both up into the mountain and down deep under the mountain. This is a very common spot for adventurers to explore and [[Care Taker]] has taken it upon himself to look after and maintain to ensure that it is not only fit for people to explore but also to stop the evils within from leaking out into the world.

# 5th Floor
The 5th floor of the dungeon is controlled by the [[Cult of the Dungeon]] and contains a large open hall in the middle of the floor there is a spiral stair case going down the the 4th floor. This large open hall has been turned to meeting point for all of the cults rituals and meetings. Here is where you will find the [[Cult of the Dungeon Leader]] stood over a large stone alter. Off of this main hall there are 4 corridors with lots of rooms coming off of them.
### South
To the south is the living quarters where many of the cult followers sleep. All of theses living rooms are very bare with little personal items allowed and a stone slab to sleep on.
### East
To the East is the cooking and storage areas where food is prepared and many items are stored such as weapons primarily used for ritual sacrifices. This corridor is filled with the smell of rotting food and flesh.
### West
To the West is very similar to the living quarters to the South but the rooms have been modified to have large metal doors instead of the simple wooden ones to the South. These rooms are used as prison cells mainly as a place to keep people and animals before they are sacrificed.
### North
To the North the corridor is shorter than the other directions and has a large wooden door at the end and 2 smaller rooms coming off of the corridor these rooms contain very crude attempts at dark magic and some corpses and skeletons.
### [[Cult of the Dungeon Leader]] Quarters
The large door at the end of the North corridor leads to a big room in this room is there the [[Cult of the Dungeon Leader]] spends most of his time. This room has a large desk in the middle with scrolls entirely covering it and all of the walls and filled with bookcases containing very old books there are a couple of chests spread around the room and lent up against one of the back bookcases is a large blood stained staff.
